# Browser Automation

This repository contains an array of examples for browser automation testing frameworks. The content is structured into distinct sections, each focusing on a potential issue that might be encountered during testing. Moreover, it provides clear and uncomplicated solutions to these challenges. To ensure straightforward comparison, each testing framework is designed to test the same scenario, all of which can be found in the corresponding sections.

The dual purpose of this repository is to offer valuable resources and enable learning. It provides guidance through the different aspects of each tool, with a focus on clear, straightforward explanations and demonstrations. It's important to note that while the included examples cover various scenarios, they don't capture every possible circumstance. They are designed to act as a catalyst for the development of unique project-specific solutions.
